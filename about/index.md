## Dundas Valley Orchestra

The DVO is comprised of talented amateur musicians from the Dundas-Hamilton area.  We welcome musicians on all orchestral instruments.  Our members range in age from late teens to youthful seniors.  The ensemble presents three major public concerts each year and performs regularly at retirement homes in the Dundas and Greater Hamilton area.  We have performed with talented vocal and instrumental soloists and combined forces with other accomplished community ensembles.

Admission to our concerts is free.  We gratefully accept donations at concerts an online.  Tax receipts are provided for donations of $10 or more.  Audience members are welcome to meet the musicians at the post-concert receptions.  Our performing home, St. Paul’s United Church in Dundas is an accessible venue with a wonderful acoustic for live orchestra performance.
