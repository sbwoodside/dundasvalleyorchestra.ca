Friends of the Dundas Valley Orchestra!

While the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we at the DVO are working on plans and projects that help us keep the music going.  While we miss playing together and performing for our audiences, we are learning new ways to make music and adapt in these unprecedented times.  We are working on video projects and virtual performances and will be updating our new Video Gallery page regularly.  Please check them out and come back often!

We were terribly disappointed that the pandemic necessitated the cancellation of the May 2020 performance of our Victory in Europe 75th anniversary concert.  We were all looking forward to playing that wonderful music for you with two talented soloists.  The good news is that we have decided that the program is not going to cancelled but postponed!  We look forward to a time when we can confidently set a new date for VE75!  Stay tuned…

We wish you all good health and, in the words of the great Vera Lynn song, we “know we’ll meet again some sunny day”.
