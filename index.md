Join us for our very special second annual Nancy Cassels Christmas chamber music concert. This is a chance to hear members of the Dundas Valley Orchestra performing music in much smaller groups which has proven to be very popular, exciting, and a fun event for everyone.

This concert will feature some seasonal selections as well as wonderful music by Dvorak, Schumann, and much more. Musicians from all the sections of the orchestra will be featured. 

Nancy Cassels, a resident of Dundas, organised, hosted, and performed in an annual Christmas chamber music concert in Dundas for forty years. Since her retirement from this endeavor, the Dundas Orchestra is proud to continue this wonderful tradition in her name.

You won’t want to miss this seasonal DVO event!

Pay what you like.
The venue is wheelchair accessible. Please remember that St. Paul’s is a fragrance-free facility.
