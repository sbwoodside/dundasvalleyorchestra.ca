Let the Dundas Valley Orchestra get your toes tapping in an exciting concert of dance music.

The DVO performs orchestral classics, along with courtly dances by English composer Benjamin Britten.

Also on the afternoon agenda is Latin music and tunes from Lord of the Dance and Henry Mancini's Pennywhistle Jig, which will showcase DVO's assistant conductor M·tÈ Szigeti on piccolo. The program will also feature the premiere performance of the new orchestration of Linda's Waltz by DVO Composer-in residence Mark Thomas.

The Music of Dance is the first performance for the DVO under the baton of new Music director Laura Thomas. A graduate of McMaster and Mohawk, Thomas began her tenure as music director in September.

"I am excited to be working with the Dundas Valley Orchestra and really looking forward to this concert," she said. "We have something for almost everyone in this programme. It will be my introduction to the audience and I hope to meet many of the DVO's supporters after the concert."

Admission is free. DVO gratefully accepts donations, and tax receipts are provided for donations of $10 or more.
