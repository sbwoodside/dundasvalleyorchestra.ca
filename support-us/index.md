# Become a Friend of the DVO!

## Invest in the future of the DVO, and support our programs, by donating by December 31, 2025

The Dundas Valley Orchestra (DVO) is a vibrant group of over 75 dedicated and talented amateur musicians who are passionate about sharing extraordinary musical experiences with our community. Through free live and virtual concerts, we bring orchestral music to audiences of all ages, making the arts accessible to everyone. 

As a Registered Charity, the DVO relies on the generous support of patrons, grant funders, sponsors, donors, and the voluntary contributions of our audience members and musicians. This community support enables us to continue presenting high-quality performances while fostering musical growth and education.

As our orchestra continues to grow in size and musical scope, so do the needs of our musicians. In particular, our percussion section‚Äîthe very heartbeat of our orchestra‚Äîis in urgent need of new and replacement instruments. These instruments are essential for both the richness and precision of our performances, allowing us to fully realize the emotional and dynamic range of the music we perform.

## As a Friend of the DVO, you can help our percussion section! Your gift will also support:

- Free community concert programming on the stage at St. Paul's United Church.
- Live streaming of concerts directly to retirement facilities and viewers at home.
- Ensemble performances at local long-term care and retirement residences in Dundas.
- Music education outreach at public schools and to community groups in Dundas.
- Partnership and performance opportunities with other musicians and arts organizations.
