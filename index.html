<h2>Dundas Valley Orchestra</h2>

<p>Laura M. Thomas, B.Mus., M.F.A., Music Director</p>

<p>The Dundas Valley Orchestra provides amateur musicians the opportunity and joy of performing orchestral music. Musicians of all ages improve their skills and share this talent by performing community concerts and free concerts at community institutions such as nursing and retirement homes.</p>
